Virtual-Machine
===============

An assignment for the class 15-122, where we implemented a virtual machine for the language C0, a subset of C. The structure is similar to that of Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and it's written in C.

EDIT : I made a private repo for this to abide with the school integrity rules.
